Immunohistologic study showed mesangial deposition of IgA, and gave the diagnosis of Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein nephritis. Glomerular changes are illustrated at higher magnification in 7.26. The names are often pronounced hee-nock and shern-line. What is now usually called Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura was first given the name Sch\u00f6nlein-Henoch syndrome in 1948. Sometimes, in English, Sch\u00f6nlein is spelled Schoenlein to avoid use of the umlaut symbol. He preceded Henoch, but now follows him in the name of this disease. Eduard Heinrich Henoch (1820-1910) was born in Berlin, and was a pupil of Sch\u00f6nlein, as was Virchow (4.5). In 1868, Henoch, who was what would now be called a pediatrician, described children with attacks of purpura, joint pains, intestinal colic, and intestinal hemorrhage. He later added the association with renal disease. Johann Lukas Sch\u00f6nlein (1793-1864) was Professor of Pathology and Therapy in W\u00fcrzburg, and then Professor of Medicine in Zurich and Berlin. His accounts of an illness with joint pains and a rash were given in various editions of a textbook written by students based on his lectures. In the 1834 edition, Sch\u00f6nlein mentioned oliguria as a finding in the condition. The first report of the finding of IgA in glomeruli in Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein nephritis seems to have been in 1968, although the significance of this was overlooked by the authors.There is a strong chance that the composer W A Mozart (1756-1791) had Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura as a boy, and died of renal failure when he was 35", "uuid": "7fcdc083-e02e-4271-ba02-71ae4442d4e2", "source": "books", "path": "../datasets/ARCH/books_set/images/7fcdc083-e02e-4271-ba02-71ae4442d4e2.png"}, "1340": {"figure_id": "399", "letter": "Single", "caption": " Artery in a renal biopsy specimen from a man of 85 with proteinuria, hematuria, and acute renal failure, stained by Congo red, which shows amyloid. 6.70 shows its appearance between crossed polariser and analyser", "uuid": "5b00a219-1f2a-49a7-a660-51e4caa86832", "source": "books", "path": "../datasets/ARCH/books_set/images/5b00a219-1f2a-49a7-a660-51e4caa86832.png"}, "1341": {"figure_id": "3100", "letter": "Single", "caption": " Cortex in a renal biopsy specimen from a man of 44 with chronic renal failure, and clinical evidence of hydronephrosis caused by retroperitoneal fibrosis.

Alports syndrome was suggested by R F Shaw and R A Glover in 1961 as a suitable name for the condition of familial renal disease with deafness, to honour Cecil Alport who described a family in 1927 (Alport AC.

The observation had been made that males were more affected than females, but Alport was the first to mention deafness in the family. In 1968, M D Crawford and P J Toghill reported that they had traced the family described by Alport, and found that the disease had disappeared from it.

Kimmelstiel, usually pronounced kimul-steel in English, and Wilson, pronounced in the usual way, described the postmortem kidneys of eight adults, seven of whom were known to have had diabetes mellitus. They found hyaline masses in the glomerular intercapillary tissue, now called the mesangium. They called this intercapillary glomerulosclerosis, but did not use the word nodule (Kimmelstiel P, Wilson C. Intercapillary lesions in the glomeruli of the kidney. American Journal of Pathology 1936; 12: 83-97). Nodule, coming from the Latin for a little knot, was in use by 1948, and the term Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesion was in use by 1951, although who was the first to think of these is difficult to discover. In Latin, the word diabetes meant a passing through or a siphon, and mellitus meant honeyed or sweet. Paul Kimmelstiel (1900-1970) was born in Hamburg, Germany, and became a pathologist there in the department of Theodor Fahr, who with the physician Franz Volhard was important in the development of understanding of the kidney through their clinicopathologic studies, first published in 1914.

In 1934, he went to Harvard University as a Rockefeller Travelling Fellow and met Kimmelstiel, who was an instructor in the Mallory Institute of Pathology. Later, Kimmelstiel worked as a pathologist in several cities in the United States.

Ernest William Goodpasture (1886-1960) was a pathologist in the United States Naval Hospital in Chelsea, Massachusetts, when he did autopsies on two young men who caught influenza at the height of the pandemic in September 1918, but he was in Harvard Medical School when he described them (Goodpasture EW. The significance of certain pulmonary lesions in relation to the etiology of influenza. Only one of the two men had disease outside the lungs. He was 18 and had pulmonary hemorrhage, vasculitis in the spleen and small intestine, and a glomerular disorder with a fibrinous exudate in Bowmans space and proliferation in tufts. In 1958, M C Stanton and J D Tange suggested the name Goodpastures syndrome for the combination of pulmonary hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis, and they took no notice of the vasculitis in the spleen and intestine in the man reported by Goodpasture. Later, the term Goodpastures disease began to be applied when Goodpastures syndrome was associated with antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies, after linear deposition of IgG in glomerular basement membranes was reported in 1964. The man with renal disease reported by Goodpasture had Goodpastures syndrome, but may not have had antibodies to glomerular basement membranes, now considered essential for the diagnosis of Goodpastures disease", "uuid": "76154f23-18a4-4943-8cf5-413ec3ea653e", "source": "books", "path": "../datasets/ARCH/books_set/images/76154f23-18a4-4943-8cf5-413ec3ea653e.png"}, "1477": {"figure_id": "3236", "letter": "Single", "caption": " Cortex in a needle biopsy specimen of kidney taken 2 weeks after transplantation into a woman of 43.

SLL/CLL can be infrequently encountered in the prostate biopsies performed for elevated PSA and/or prostate enlargement. Such infiltrate is often overlooked as nonspecific chronic inflammation. If monotonous small lymphocytic infiltrate is multifocal/diffuse in distribution and is not centered around ducts and acini, a lymphoproliferative process should be considered and ruled out (a and b). Review of clinical history including peripheral blood counts along with a select panel of immunohistochemical markers should be performed to rule out SLL/CLL. In this example, the patient had CLL and small monotonous lymphoid infiltrate in prostate biopsy demonstrated expression for B cell markers CD79a (strong; c) and CD20 (weak) with coexpression of CD43 and CD5 and lack of expression for CD3, supporting the diagnosis of CLL involving the prostate gland", "uuid": "22b813a5-704e-478d-a2b8-a52ff3023edd", "source": "books", "path": "../datasets/ARCH/books_set/images/22b813a5-704e-478d-a2b8-a52ff3023edd.png"}, "2401": {"figure_id": "5109", "letter": "Single", "caption": " Malakoplakia.
