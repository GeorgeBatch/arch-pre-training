Virchow apparently pronounced his surname feer-cho, with the ch as the Scottish pronounce it in loch, but several other pronunciations are used in English.

Alports syndrome was suggested by R F Shaw and R A Glover in 1961 as a suitable name for the condition of familial renal disease with deafness, to honour Cecil Alport who described a family in 1927 (Alport AC. Hereditary familial congenital haemorrhagic nephritis. British Medical Journal 1927; 1: 504-506). The name is pronounced awl-port or al-port. Arthur Cecil Alport (1880-1959) was born in South Africa, and qualified in medicine in Edinburgh, United Kingdom. In 1922, he was appointed second assistant to the medical unit at St Marys Hospital Medical School in London, which he left in 1937 to become professor of medicine in Cairo, Egypt. The family he described had already been reported four times, by L G Guthrie in 1902, G Kendall and A F Hertz in 1912, Hertz again in 1923 but after a change of surname to Hurst, and J Eason, G L M Smith and G Buchanan in 1924. The observation had been made that males were more affected than females, but Alport was the first to mention deafness in the family. In 1968, M D Crawford and P J Toghill reported that they had traced the family described by Alport, and found that the disease had disappeared from it. The characteristic changes in glomerular basement membranes were first described in 1972. Electron microscopy was never done on glomeruli in Alports family", "uuid": "6dbe19d4-01b2-40e6-9fa7-217169234690", "source": "books", "path": "../datasets/ARCH/books_set/images/6dbe19d4-01b2-40e6-9fa7-217169234690.png"}, "1351": {"figure_id": "3110", "letter": "Single", "caption": " Glomerulus in a renal biopsy specimen from a man of 42 with asthma, neuropathy, arthropathy, hematuria, proteinuria, and normal renal function.

In 1958, M C Stanton and J D Tange suggested the name Goodpastures syndrome for the combination of pulmonary hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis, and they took no notice of the vasculitis in the spleen and intestine in the man reported by Goodpasture. Later, the term Goodpastures disease began to be applied when Goodpastures syndrome was associated with antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies, after linear deposition of IgG in glomerular basement membranes was reported in 1964.
