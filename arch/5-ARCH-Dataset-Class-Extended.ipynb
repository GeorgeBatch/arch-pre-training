Richard Bright (1789-1858), whose surname is pronounced in the usual way, was born in Bristol, United Kingdom, qualified in medicine in Edinburgh, and became a physician at Guys Hospital at the same time as Addison and Hodgkin, who also had diseases named after them. In 1827, Bright published a book called Reports of medical cases selected with a view of illustrating the symptoms and cure of diseases by a reference to morbid anatomy. He showed the association of edema, then called anasarca or dropsy or dropsical affection, with proteinuria and disorders of the kidney, and separated edema due to renal disorders from edema due to diseases of the heart and liver.
